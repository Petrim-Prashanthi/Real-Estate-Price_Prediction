# Real Estate Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Predict real estate property prices based on features such as location, area, number of rooms, and amenities.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model Evaluation using RMSE and R²

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved better prediction accuracy compared to Linear Regression.

## Future Improvements
The model can be integrated into a web application for real-time price prediction.
